Athena: The wives of the Jewish men thought they were being unfair to us, and
urged them to have sex with us. So they started a heated debate about what the
Jewish tradition said about that.
Josephus: So these women studied that?
Athena: Probably not, but they faked it really well. But the men still didn’t
want to have sex with us, because of Jehovah of course.

Josephus’ Voice: Oh, great, Egyptians! Widely considered to be the most
desirable and beautiful girls. Stay strong, Josephus, act nonchalantly - just
ignore them.
[ He passed by them only to hear one say «A good name is better than good oil»
( http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/7-1.htm ) in perfect Aramaic. ]
Josephus: Oh! God help Me! [Out loud while trying to obscure his view.]

Josephus: So did you give up on them?
Athena: Not on your life! We wanted them more! And more badly!
[From Friends: “As a woman, there is nothing sexier than a man who doesn’t
want to have sex.”]

Jacob: Yes, I see now. Anyway, as blasphemous as this Qoheleth thing of yours
is - it brought great appreciation to the Jews of this town. Respect!
[ Jacob hits Josephus on the shoulder - Josephus sways a little. ]
Josephus: Thank you! Anyway, do not take it too seriously - it’s just cheap
entertainment, as philosophy goes.

Faith: Oh, look at me: Faith, the fierce vampire slayer, crying like a baby!
I’m so pathetic!
Xander: [From the background of the frame.] Crying does not make you weak.
On the contrary - it’s one way of fighting.

Willow: Yes, Deborah, you are right. We tried to hide it from you, but I
guess we should not have. We should have been more honest.
Deborah: That’s quite alright, mummy. See, my friend told me his father who
is a Philosophy professor told him that honesty is an active process, and
that honest people were always more dishonest in the past. I forgive you.

Buffy: Oh, my friend, Rachel, that software developer chick who moved here,
told me that ever since she bought a dog, she made so many friends and lots of
guys showed interest in her, and she’s been telling me about her exploits with
them endlessly.
Willow: So she has become a slut? So cool!
